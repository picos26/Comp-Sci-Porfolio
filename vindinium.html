        <p>Vindinium was our second to last project of expeditions. For this project we created a bot. Then, with the bot we had to give it commands so it could do stuff during the match. We made a match and in it the bots had to collect mines, when it got low health it had to go to a tavern to get health. I programed my bot to get free mines, also to attack the person with the lowest health and with the most mines. Lather on in the project everyone got their bot working. So we created a tournament for fun. I got out in the second round of the tournament.</p>
        <p>if(task === "attack mostMines") {
            console.log("attack mostMines");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, mostMinesIndex);
        }</p>
        <p>The code above makes my bot attack the person with the most mines. It also makes my bot find the best path so he could attack the person with the most moines.</p>
        <p>if(task === "nearest tavern") {
            var closesttavern = bot.taverns[0];
            for(i = 0; i < bot.taverns.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closesttavern) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.taverns[i])) {
                    closesttavern = bot.taverns[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("Getting my health up!");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closesttavern);}</p>
        <p>The code above makes my bot go to the nearest tavern when it has low health. It makes it find the best path to go to the tavern. The task that it's giving it is to go the the closest tavern. It's also making find the length of each tavern to see which one is the closest to it.</p>
