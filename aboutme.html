I been to Lake Tahoe and Reno, well those are my favorite places I been too.Those are my 2 favorite places because in Lake Tahoe I got to swim and in Reno I got to go to Circus Circus and play in the little kids casino, and I got a lot of tickets and bought a lot of prizes with the tickets. My least favorite places I been to are Manteca and Modesto because it's really hot. I also like playing soccer, I play with a team named SMC Star.
